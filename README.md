### ✨ **Hi, I'm Javier**
👔I’ve been an entrepreneur since my 20s, running several businesses with my wife (meal prep, nail salon, landscaping)<br/>

💼Through entrepreneurship, I developed problem-solving, discipline, and resilience — qualities I now bring to cybersecurity.<br/>

👾I’ve always been fascinated by technology and computers, with a gamer’s mindset that drives my curiosity to understand how systems work behind the scenes.<br/>

💻Now, I’m pursuing a new career in cybersecurity, focusing on Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, and Incident Response.<br/>
